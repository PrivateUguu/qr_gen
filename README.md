# qr_gen
A rust based command line QR code generator. Run on the command line with your string as an argument.

```bash
./qr_gen "Hello, world!"
```
Note: This was just a quick hello world program to demonstrate why code isn't necessarily scary, and how Github works for a dear friend. I don't recommend anyone actually use this.
